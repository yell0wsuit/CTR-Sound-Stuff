# 3DSUSoundArchiveTool
A tool written to extract sequences and banks from BCSAR and BFSAR sound archives. This tool is still in the works, and is not very user friendly. The plan is to integrate this with vgmstream in order to output looping sound samples, and also to automatically compile those samples into soundfonts.
